# flowmeo
Flowmeo is a web tool for making monodirectional flowcharts (i.e. ones where the flow can never go "backwards").

I created it to help me plan and design video games where, for example, you have to do A before B and B before C, and then you have to do C and D before you can do E.

You can try it out here: https://luvcraft.github.io/flowmeo/

I built it using React (https://reactjs.org/) and Mermaid.js (https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/)
